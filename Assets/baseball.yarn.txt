It’s the day of the 2nd grade field trip, and you can’t wait. You and your friends Laney and Sally have been waiting for this all year. This year, you’re going to Fenway Park to get a tour!

You, Laney, and Sally are all on the local girl’s little league team. Laney is the shortstop, Sally is the pitcher, and you’re the star hitter. You’re also the left outfielder, but you’re not very good at catching. Or throwing. But you sure can hit the ball. The three of you are looking forward to seeing all the amazing things the park has to offer. It's been through a lot since it opened in 1912, but it looks as good as ever. You look forward to seeing the Green Monster, the giant green wall of concrete and plastic along the left field. Your dad told you that there are dents in the wall from baseballs, and you want to see for yourself.

Miss Inglewood talks to the man at the front gate. He says something to her, and she leads your class through the turnstiles and into a set of tunnels. Your group keeps walking and eventually makes it out onto the field itself. The park looks so much bigger from the inside. The grass smells freshly cut and the sky above is bright and blue. The Green Monster looms in your peripheral vision. Laney nudges you and points to the famous Lone Red Seat in the stands. You can feel it -- this is going to be an amazing day.

"Isn't it wonderful?" says Miss Inglewood. You nod your head. It's all you could have hoped for in a ball park.

Miss Inglewood leaves to go get the tour guide. The other kids mull about the field, talking or playing games. You hang around Laney and Sally.

“We should go exploring while Miss Inglewood’s gone,” says Laney. She’s the adventurous one of your group. Sally agrees. You think it would be pretty amazing to explore the park unsupervised, but you also think that you should stay with the group.

“Come on,” says Sally. “Don’t be a wuss.”

Laney and Sally groan when you tell them that you should stay with the group, but they agree to stay. You sit down in the grass and make small talk for a little while.

After a few minutes, Miss Inglewood returns with a woman in a clean uniform. She must be the tour guide. The tour guide waves and, once she is within earshot, addresses the group.

"Good afternoon, class! My name is Amy, and I will be your tour guide today."

"Hi, Amy!" chants the class.

"Are you looking forward to the tour?" asks Amy. The class agrees enthusiastically. Amy smiles and asks the class to follow her. Laney rolls her eyes at you. You grin and shrug. You follow the rest of the class and get ready to start the tour.

Amy the tour guide leads your class to the home team's dugout. You all help each other climb into the deep recess. After you were all inside the dugout, Amy began her talk. "Fenway Park was built in 1911 under the guidance of John Irving Taylor," she said. "Mr. Taylor was the owner of the Boston Red Sox at the time, and he wanted a baseball stadium for his team." Amy goes through a door and leads you deeper into the stadium. The class crowds excitely into a small-ish stone hallway.

You lean over to say something to Laney, but she isn't next to you anymore. Uh oh! Did she run off to explore without you? As you turn around to look for Laney, you bump into her. "Ouch!" hisses Laney.

"Sorry!" you whisper back. Something moves in the corner of you eye and you look, just to see Mrs. Inglewood slip through an unlabelled door. Very strange. Shouldn't she be supervising the class? Laney nudges you.

"Now's our chance!" she whispers. You do kind of want to see where Mrs. Inglewood is going. But you hate to break the rules, even if your teacher is behaving strangely.

You grab Laney and Sally's hands and lead them to the unlabelled door. You glance back at Amy the tour guide, but she seems to be distracted by her tour guide schpiel. You take a deep breath and open the door. The room beyond is dim. You don't see any side of your teacher, though, so you head inside.

The room appears to be a storage space. There are rows of metal shelves, covered in baseball gear and boxes. In the far corner there is a large sink and some cleaning supplies. The three of you split up and being to explore. 

After a few minutes, Sally calls out to you. She's standing by the sink. You head over. "There are footprints here," says Sally. "And I think this is a scrap of Mrs. Inglewood's dress!" Laney jumps up and down, excitedly.

"A secret passage!" she exclaims. You'd definitely agree with that. But how are you going to open it?

You turn the left knob. The sink shudders and begins to slide to the right, revealing a small tunnel. You're wary of entering, but by the time you try to say something, Laney is already inside, and Sally is starting to go in. You sigh, and follow your friends into the tunnel. Someone's got to watch out for these two!

The tunnel is chilly, and a bit damp. You crawl for what seems like ten minutes, going through various twists and turns. Finally, you reach an exit.

You turn the right knob. The sink shudders, then goes quiet. Suddenly, the floor opens up beneath you. You, Sally, and Laney fall into a deep pit. You try to climb the walls, but they are very smooth. Mrs. Inglewood leans over the edge of the pit with a flashlight.

"This is what happens when you don't stick with the group, girls!" And with that, she disappears. You call out for help, but your teacher doesn't come back. There doesn't seem to be anyone else around to hear you.

THE END
