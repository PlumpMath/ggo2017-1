You turn the left knob. The sink shudders and begins to slide to the right, revealing a small tunnel. You're wary of entering, but by the time you try to say something, Laney is already inside, and Sally is starting to go in. You sigh, and follow your friends into the tunnel. Someone's got to watch out for these two!

The tunnel is chilly, and a bit damp. You crawl for what seems like ten minutes, going through various twists and turns. Finally, you reach an exit. 

"Cool! Let's see what's going on!" Laney exclaims.
Before she can burst out onto the scene, you quickly put your hand on her shoulder.

"Hey! What gives?"

You slowly let go of her shoulder. This may be a weird situation, but what's the worst that could possibly happen? Free of your grasp Laney and Sally jump out of the tunnel's exit into a hallway. 
"Wow what is this place? It's so weird!" says Sally, with a hint of nervousenes creeping into her voice.
You slowly begin to crawl forward to meet them when you suddenly hear footsteps. Laney and Sally both look up to the right.
"Sorry girls, but no students allowed," the voice says. It's Ms. Inglewood.
You see both of your friends take a few steps back. "Ms. Inglewood, where are we? What's going on!" Sally cries out.
"I may be your teacher, but today I'm not taking any more questions. Class is dismissed," Ms. Inglewood says menacingly.
Laney and Sally turn to run when suddenly a bright flash of light and crackling sound fills the tunnel.

Frantically you turn around and start crawling back through the tunnel, still blinded by the flash of light. The smell of burnt hair fills your nostrils, sending you into a panic. You desperately grope your hand against the wall to help guide you out but find a particularly moist section.
Your hand slips, causing you to fall and let out a yelp.
"Oh, looks like someone has joined us for detention," sneers Ms. Inglewood.
Eyes blurred you look back down the tunnel and see Ms. Inglewood pointing some sort of contraption at you.
Another flash of light fills the tunnels. You hear nothing.

Blinded, you suddenly realize the smell of burnt hair has filled your hiding spot.
"Pity," you hear Ms. Inglewood chortle, "You were both such bright students!"
You clamp your hands over your mouth. To prevent you from screaming or vomitting, you don't know. Either way it seems to do the trick. You hear Ms. Inglewood begin to walk again and soon you hear her footsteps dissapear in the distance. As your vision returns you decide what you must do next.

This is crazy! Ms. Inglewood is some kind of crazy mad scientist with a raygun! What are you supposed to do! You do the sensible thing and turn around and scramble out of the tunnels and back to the dugout. Frantically you try to look for someone to tell, preferably an adult. Then you see out on the field, Amy, still leading the class giving her schpiel. She'll have to do. Almost out of breath, you run towards her screaming. Her and the rest of the class turn to you, looking very confused. As you make it past first base you suddenly hear a loud CHUNK sound.
CHUNK.
CHUNK CHUNK CHUNK.
The sound speeds up in frequency, almost like large mechanical gears turning. Underfoot you feel the ground begin to shake. In front of you a crack appears in the turf, quickly growing until a huge chasm is between you and the rest of the school group.
"HAHAHAHAHAHA!" you hear the cackle of Ms. Inglewood come from the unseen depths.
The ground begins to shake again, and from the shadows appears some sort of large machine, rising from the Earth.
"What in the world!" you hear Amy shout from across the gap.
Now towering in front of you, you see it. A giant laser.
"Finally I have the means to fullfill my ultimate goal!" shouts Ms. Inglewood triumphantly.
"Why are you doing this!" you cry out.
"It's simple really," says Ms. Inglewood. "You see, I never wanted to have to teach you stupid brats. I was supposed to go to Harvard for a double major in Areospace Engineering and Chemistry! I was going to be famous! I had worked so hard my entire life, prepared for years. I had the perfect application! But the stupid postal service in this forsaken city had lost my application! I knew something was wrong when I hadn't heard from them immediately. I waited weeks and not a single peep! That's when I called and they told me that my application had never even arrived. I told them there was some kind of mistake, that I had sent my application, that I would go and deliver it to them in person if I had to, but they said it was too late. They were giving me! A genius! The cold-shoulder! How dare they! From that day on I began my plan to destroy this horrid reminder of what I could have been, and wiping it from the face of the Earth!"
After finishing her monologue, Ms. Inglewood reaches to the large lever beside her, and pulls it. A terrifying noise fills the air and electricity begins to spark from the end of the laser.
The last thing you see is the psychotic smile on Ms. Inglewoods face.

You pull Laney and Sally back into the tunnel, telling them you all need to be more cautious. From outside into the hallway the three of you hear footsteps quickly approaching. 
"Do you think that's Ms. Inglewo--" Laney trys to say before you cover her mouth.
After waiting a moment the sound of footsteps fade away into the distance.
Laney shakes free of your grasp. "Okay enough hanging out in cramped tunnels," she says taking hold of you and Sally's hand as she jumps out into the hallway.
"Well this is creepy."
Your trio examines the long, dim hallway. The ceiling and walls just covered in wires and tubes filled with strange glowing liquid.
"What is this place? Is Ms. Inglewood some sort of mad scientist?" whispers Sally.
"Well she's not just a teacher, that's obviously clear," you reply.
"She's up to something sinister, that seems pretty clear too," snaps Laney. "We have to find out what she's up to. Come on."
You follow the strange hallway in the direction of Ms. Inglewood. On the way you see a bunch of wires leading to what appears to be a large battery.
"What should we do guys?" Sally asks.

"Well I doubt that it's powering a merry-go round," Laney says walking up to the battery.
She gives it a push. It doesn't seem to have any effect.
"Gah, this thing weighs a ton! C'mon help me out here!" She yells.
As you step up, the ground begins to shake. Looking around you can see the pipes of glowing liquid begin to flow in the direction Ms. Inglewood went.
"Hurry!" Laney yells.
The three of you begin pushing on the battery with all of your might as dust falls from the celing and the ground conintues to shake.
Finally with a final heave you are able to remove the giant battery from place. Almost immediately the shaking stops, as well as the flow of the liquid. 
The three of you look further down a hall and see what looks to be sunlight coming from a slightly ajar door. As fast as you can muster, you run with your friends towards it.
Opening the door you find a giant room with no ceiling, and a giant contraption towering over you, peaking its head above ground.
Above you hear Ms. Inglewood yelling and cursing.
Shortly after police helicopters appear in the sky. You begin to yell and flail your arms about to get their attention.
After your rescue you learn that Ms. Inglewood was a disgruntled genius that had a bone to pick with the city of Boston.
You and your friends are praised as heroes, and are given the key to the city!

Congratulations!

"This doesn't look very safe guys. Lets just keep going," you say as you back away from the giant hazard. You look further down the hallway and see a closed door. Slowly your group inches foward. Dust begins to fall from the ceiling.
"What's going on," says Sally nervously.
Suddenly the hallway begins to shake. You look around frantically and see all of the green liquid in the pipes has begun flowing towards the closed door.
"C'mon guys lets hurry!" Laney yells.
The three of you begin sprinting forward. But the vibrations continue to get worse.
Sally trips and falls to the ground beside you. You can hear the ground above cracking.
Laney runs back to Sally to try and help her. You look up at the ceiling just in time to see a giant slab of concrete falling towards your head.
The three of you are never seen again.

You can't just let Ms. Inglewood get away with this. You decide you must do something! To stop whatever she's planning! 
You exit the tunnel and find a long, dimly lit hallway. The ceiling and walls covered in wires and tubes filled with strange glowing liquid.
"What is this place? Is Ms. Inglewood some sort of mad scientist?" you mutter to yourself. You follow the strange hallway in the direction of Ms. Inglewood. On the way you see a bunch of wires leading to what appears to be a large battery.
"What the..."

"Well whatever this is powering can't be good," you say walking up to the battery.
You try to give it a push. It doesn't seem to have any effect.
You try again and again, nothing. It's just too heavy for you. If only your friends were still alive.
As you step back, the ground begins to shake. Looking around you can see the pipes of glowing liquid begin to flow in the direction Ms. Inglewood went. The loud ear-peircing sound of machiery soon follows, along with even more intesnse quakes shaking the hallway. Dust and debris fall on you from the celing
Down the hallway you see light appear under a door that the quakes have cause to come ajar.
As fast as you can muster, you run towards it.
Opening the door you find a giant room with no ceiling, and a giant contraption towering over you, peaking its head above ground. At the seat of the controls you spy none other than Ms. Inglewood, laughing maniaclly. You see her pull a giant lever beside her as eletricity sprouts from the towering object.

It's the last thing you ever see.
