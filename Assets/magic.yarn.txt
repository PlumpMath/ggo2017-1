You arrive at the docks, knees weak and palms sweaty. Since you were young you've had to keep this secret from your friends. That from the age of 5 your parents have been teaching you the magical arts.
It doesn't really matter though. The regulars, as your parents called them, wouldn't believe you anyway. Without a word to them you left that morning to start a new chapter of your life.
Your father shuts off the car engine and goes to the back to open the trunk to get your suitcase. You wonder why you bothered to drive here instead of using magic. Dad says it wasn't an experience you were ready for but a part of you doesn't believe him. 
Maybe he was just used to his regular ways after living among them for so long. You and your mother step out of the car as your dad comes around with your suitcase.
"You'll be taking the ferry from here," he says, pointing to the run down ship in the distance.
"We're so proud that you were able to the top magic school in the county!", exclaims your Mom as tears slowly drip from her eyes.

You lean in towards your parents, wrapping your arms around them. "I love you guys," you say as your voice cracks under the weight of their expectations.
"We love you too. We know you'll do fantastic at school!" your father says softly as his eyes begin to water.
Slowly you pull back from your parent's embrace. Their tears have left small salty stains on your coat.
"I've put a little surprise in your suitcase, make sure you wait until you get to your dorm room to open it!" your mother says gleefully.
"You have about half and hour before the ship leaves. If you're hungry they should have some food on the ferry. From what I remember it wasn't the best but it'll do," your father warns.
"Now get going. Make lots of friends!"
You say your final goodbyes and you turn towards the ship. You see some other students have started to congregate in front of the ramp leading to the deck.

You stand still and don't move a muscle. You can feel your eyes drying as you stare blankly at your parents. Shame and regret fills their face.
Quickly you realize how awkward you've made this situation, but you're too stunned to take corrective action.
"We know you're nervous, but please try to not embarrass yourself. And please try to make some friends. I know you have a difficult time but just try," your Mom says with a hint of disdain.
You've known for a while your social skills have been lacking. Most of your friendships up to this point have been due to convenience and proximity, and your weird penchant to hang around the neighbourhood kids without saying a word.
Maybe this will be the year, your year. The year you finally take the first steps into be a regular non-regular magical person.

You stand in place. Staring blankly ahead you hear your parents mumbling to each other behind you under their breath.
"You okay sweety?" your Mom asks nervously.
"Everything's going to be fine," your Dad attempts to say in an assuring fashion, but you guess he may have his own doubts.
Your mother slowly reaches out her hand and nudges you in the shoulder.

A horn bellows in the distance. You can feel the vibrations enter your ears and resonate with your body.
"It's been half an hour already! You have to hurry to the boat now!" your Dad shouts behind you.
You try to lift your foot but it is firmly planted in place. Thoughts fill your mind. How you'll be letting your family down if you don't make it onto the ferry.
How you'll be throwing away the years of magic training you have gone through. About all of the work and time your parents have invested into you. All for nothing.
Can you take that firs step

The ferry's horn sounds off again. You just won't budge. You can't. In the distance you can see the ship set sail, slowly escaping into the sunrise. Tears fall to the ground behind you, and shatter like your dreams of a better life.

You begin to fill with self-loathing. As rage builds up inside of you you can feel the ground and air heat up around you.
You white out.

Finally you snap out of your trance. Feeling as though a hex has been lifted your heart races. You run forward a few feet before returning to grab your suitcase. You sprint as fast as you can towards the ship. Magic, while convenient, has also caused you to be a tad out of shape and unfortunately the use of magic at your age can only be used in emergency and educational situations. Its not like you teleporation skills were that great anyway and you wouldn't want to get off on the wrong foot with your new classmates, which would be more likely to happen if you showed up to your first day with only one.
Ahead you see the students slowly make their way up the ramp to the deck.
"Hurry up kid or we're going to set sail without you!" shouts a man from the bow.

As you sprint you see the deck hands begin to untie the knots holding the ferry to the dock. Out of surprising coincidence your shoelaces decide to follow suit and untie themselves. With an exasperated yell you trip and fall face first into the concrete. Could this be the end of your whole magical career, right then and there? "No," you mutter under your breath. You close your eyes and concentrate, imagining your body moving from where you are, with your face bloodied and arms scraped, to the deck of the ferry. You feel heat slowly build up inside of you, and suddenly feel it release from your body.

You open your eyes laying on your back. Students and crew members surround you, their eyes wide. "I did it," you think to yourself. You try to get up but your exhaustion prevents you. You close your eyes once more. Suddenly a young boy beside you screams out. You open your eyes to look at his face, morphed hidiously by terror. Beside him one of the crew members vomits.
"Someone get the nurse! Quick!" shouts a voice you cannot see.
You wonder what could be going on as you feel a liquid start pooling around your ear. Using what remains of your strenght you try to look around.
You see blood. A lot of blood.
It turns out you were as good at magic as you thought, but less than you hoped, and that your top half is no long on top of your bottom half.
The remaining students are too mortified by the sight of you to continue with the school year. The magical community takes a huge hit due to a generation of uneducated individuals.

The salt in the air fills your nostrils as you begin to walk around the docks. You're reminded of the summer days you spent at the beach with your family. To your right you see a boat of fishermen set off in the early morning. The seaguls hitching a ride squack in excitement. You feel the breeze of the ocean as it gently blows across your face. It fills you with determination.

Suddenly the sound of the ships horn cracks through the serene setting! Time to begin your journey.
