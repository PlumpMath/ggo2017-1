You're no wuss, and you make sure Sally knows as much as the three of you take advantage of Miss Inglewood's absence to break off from the group waiting in the in-field and start climbing your way through the bleachers. No offense to Miss I.'s ability to plan a school trip, but you're fairly certain you don't need a boring old tour guide to know how to have fun at a baseball diamond!
The three of you take turns sitting in the famous red seat marking the longest home run ever hit at the park and watch as your teacher and classmates follow a woman in a white uniform around the field in the distance. They stop a few times along the way, presumably to listen to the tour guide's spiel.
Laney turns to you and Sally and whispers "Hey, do you think they'll be able to see us up here?"
Your classmates aren't paying any attention to the bleachers at the moment, but surely the tour's going to at least mention the Lone Red Seat (seriously -- what tour wouldn't?). It is pretty far out though -- almost 500 feet -- so if you take it easy they probably won't even notice you. You're wearing red today anyways; you'll blend right in.

While the guide's drawing everyone's attention towards the giant green wall, you take the lead and start sneaking your way around to the other side of the bleachers. You have to hush your compatriots multiple times as they giggle their way through your clever maneuver. Peeking out from over the seats, you keep an eye on the rest of your class as they make the rounds. By the time the tour guide points out the crimson chair, your triumvirate is nowhere to be seen.
It seems the bold bleacher was the last stop on the tour, and you watch as your classmates, like a little line of ants, file their way back into the park's interior. You're all scheduled to play a game together on the field after lunch, which means that you've got a whole hour out here to yourself!
Sally and Laney are way ahead of you, and have already started bounding their way back down onto the grass. You chase after them, and soon enough the three of you are racing to see who can complete a lap of the diamond first. They got a head-start, but it's neck-and-neck in the last stretch, at which point it falls apart as all three of you fail to restrain yourselves from trying to dramatically slide into home base and completely undershooting.
As you laugh and dust yourself off, Laney wanders over to the dugout and hops in. She returns wielding a metal bat and a mischievous grin, tossing Sally a couple leftover balls from who-knows-when.

As much as you'd like to indulge in the moment, there's something here that you don't think Laney and Sally will be able to enjoy with you, and now may be your only chance to find it. Before they have a chance to wrangle you into a pickup game, you wonder aloud if there's time for you to grab lunch before Miss Inglewood gets back with the rest of the class and tell them not to wait up for you. They seem a little surprised by your sudden ambivalence as you stride off the diamond, but a couple strikes later and they've got more exciting swings to worry about than your mood.
You make your way inside, but instead of following the sounds of the other children's voices, you start tracing the path you planned out in the days leading up to this trip. A left here, a right just past there -- your heartbeat quickens as you get closer and closer to your goal -- five more steps, then two...
Just as you turn the corner, you spot what you're looking for: the entrance to the home team's locker room! And more importantly: the small section of false plaster on the opposing wall which you know houses the secret passage to the grand sport Cathedral's greatest mystery: the Catacombs of Ba'll.

You run your hands over the wall, examining each and every tiny bump and imperfection, looking for the one that activates whatever hidden mechanism keeps the entrance sealed. It takes a few minutes of careful prodding, but eventually your fingers depress and you hear a soft *<smallcaps>click</smallcaps>* as the wall gives way.
The false plaster starts swinging slowly inwards as you apply more pressure, revolving on a central axis. You crouch your head slightly to make it through the small opening, and make your way inside. The door continues swinging as you do, turning a full 180° before clicking shut, leaving you in the darkness within. You have a nagging suspicion that you won't be able to leave the same way you came in.
Not one to be caught unprepared, you fumble blindly through your pockets for a moment and produce a small flashlight. Illuminating the walls around you, it's clear that you're on the right track, as the construction here is clearly much older. The contemporary plaster of the entrance stands in stark contrast to the crumbling stone and wooden supports that line the rest of the chamber.
Turning your gaze forward, you spot a small staircase a few steps in front of you leading deeper into the darkness. 
Your fore-knowledge of the layout ends here, but looks like you know where you're headed for the time being.

The stairs travel straight down for a few meters through exposed rock. At first it looks like incredibly shoddy workmanship -- hastily hewn stone meant to serve no purpose other than locomotion, but as you walk further down, the rough markings and cuts start to give way to flatter, more refined surfaces. The steps begin to widen, and then transition into a lazy spiral as more and more evidence of artistry appears on the walls that pass you by: a noticeable trim along edges, clear markers every dozen steps, purely aesthetic patterning that must have taken someone ages to carve...
Soon enough, you find yourself slowing to admire details here and there. To think; all this and more could have gone unnoticed by so many for so long! You fight back a slight twinge of guilt as you think of your classmates above, eating hot-dogs and playing ball as you explore hidden depths on your own. You remind yourself that they're having a good time too, and of course that yours is an experience that only a select few could appreciate.
Distracted momentarily by your thoughts, you stumble awkwardly as your foot plants down sooner than expected: you've reached the bottom of the stairwell! Recovering your balance, you survey the area. To your left, the floor levels out into a long, narrow tunnel that stretches as far as the beam from your flashlight will reach. To your right lies a small alcove engraved in ornate detail. It may be a good opportunity to try to learn more about these mysterious passageways. On the other hand, you are on a bit of a tight schedule -- maybe you should just keep moving.

You take a closer look at the alcove to your right. It houses a limestone bust portraying a man from the chest up, rendered in exquisite detail. You don't recognize the face, but admire the craft that went into capturing such a striking jawline -- such piercing eyes. You can't help but wonder what it must have looked like before the passage of time stripped it of pigment, but even the raw stone is a thing of beauty.
The figure's arms are held delicately by its sides, elbows bent and palms facing upwards. In his right hand, a similarly sculpted bat is balanced vertically, and in his left, the ball. A small plaque is mounted to the platform on which the statue rests. Shining your flashlight on it, you read the words engraved upon it:

<align=center><smallcaps><i><b><br>Hey batta-hatta bee
Hey hatta-batta hall
Which o'these came first
Bat or the Ba'll?</b></i></smallcaps></align>

Ah, so it's a riddle then? It's pretty clear you're expected to choose from the offerings presented in the figure's hands, though you have no clue what consequences your choice will have.

You're a bit surprised anyone thought this would fool would-be intruders; everyone knows the bat came first. You grasp the stone bat in your hand. A few seconds pass, but nothing happens.
You're sure of your answer, but maybe you've misunderstood the mechanism? Experimenting, you give the bat a light tug. A few more seconds pass, and then you give it a slightly less light tug. On this second attempt, you feel something give way, and the arm holding it starts to swivel on some hidden joint.
There's an ominous creaking and the grinding of stone sliding against stone as you continue to pull the bat down like some sort of lever. As it falls into place, you feel a dull rumbling begin in the floor below you. The rumble grows as it rises up through the walls until the entire chamber is shaking. Dust and rubble start to break loose from the ceiling.
Relatively safe in the confines of the alcove, you watch as cracks shoot through the stairs you were descending just minutes ago, and suddenly there are huge slabs of stone crashing all around them.
By the time the rumbling subsides, a giant pile of rubble blocks what's left of your only known exit to the surface. To be honest, you're not sure if you've triggered a trap, or if this thing just hasn't survived the test of time and fell apart before it could complete its intended purpose. In either case, you're going to have to keep an eye out for a new way out of here. Clouds of dust kicked up by the commotion begin to settle as you consider your options.

Given the circumstances, you're fairly certain there's no way for you to actually figure out what this riddle was intending to communicate during the time of its construction. Language often changes and evolves over the course of a few years, let alone generations. You place your palm on the top of the stone ball and hope for the best.
The arm of the statue lowers and begins to rotate under the weight of your hand. As it does, you feel a sudden rushing sensation: the floor below you just collapsed into a trapdoor! Reflexes kicking in as you start to fall, you manage to hook one flailing hand onto the edge of the newly opened pit.
You glance below you and see your flashlight -- you must have dropped it in the excitement -- tumbling into the darkness below. Watching in horror as your only source of light dims and eventually disappears, you realize just how far you have to fall. Eager to put yourself in a less precarious position, you swing your free arm blindly for a handhold, only to end up knocking a few more rocks loose. Your fingers strain as you hold on for dear life, and the gravity of the situation sets in: you're alone in the dark, no one knows where you are, and the only thing keeping you from a five-storey drop is a bit of rapidly dwindling grip strength.

Obviously, the riddle is a trick question: without the ball, what use would you have for the bat, and vice versa? The two go hand in hand, and following that logic, you simultaneously reach out with both hands to grasp the stone sports gear.
It occurs to you a few moments later that you may have been a bit too hasty in coming to that clever conclusion. You take comfort in the fact that this self-doubt will soon be cut short as you plummet through the crumbling floor and into the pit below.

The passageway widens as you make your way forwards, and the walls give way to more and more natural formations, with only the path itself maintaining the smooth, carved stone from before.
It doesn't take an expert to realize that these tunnels are ancient. Massive spires of rock and mineral hang from the ceiling and jut out of the ground, their faces lined with the many layers of sediment deposits and smoothed with erosion.
As you continue walking, they eventually open up further into a vast underground lake, its bed pock-marked with dozens of channels leading who-knows-where. The surface of the lake is so blue as to appear glowing in comparison to the dim lighting you've had to navigate thus far. You've heard of species of bioluminescent algae said to produce a similar effect, though they usually require a steady cycle of daylight. Perhaps something else is causing the brightness?
Each footstep you take as you make your way towards the water's edge to investigate triggers a trailing cacophony of echoes, sounds bouncing and reverberating throughout the vast caverns. You stop to enjoy the acoustics for a moment, and suddenly realize that the footsteps didn't stop until a moment after you had planted your feet. You're being followed!
Listening carefully, you try to pin-point the source of the other steps. The natural reverb makes it difficult to be certain, but you estimate there to be two adult men in leather moccasins trailing you, at least one of which is almost within striking distance. You could try to take advantage of the fact that they've lost the element of surprise to launch an immediate counter-offensive, or you could go for a dive and try to lose them in the depths below.

If these punks think they can get the jump on you, they've got another thing coming! Having taken stock of the situation, you draw your trusty Smith & Wesson Model 40 snub-nosed revolver from the folds of your jacket in a split-second, but your opponents are even faster: before you even have a chance to line up an attack, a lightning-quick karate chop knocks the weapon from your hand and sends it clattering along the stone floor to the left.
Not one to give up easily, you grab your attacker's arm and use his weight to judo flip him over your shoulder. The towering man is sent tumbling through the air in a magnificent arc, and there's a thundering <smallcaps>*smack*</smallcaps> and the wheeze of forced exhalation as your assailant lands flat on his back. Not bad, but the fight's not over yet.
You adopt a defensive stance as you turn to face the remaining attacker, only to find yourself staring down the twin barrels of the Remington Over-Under Double Derringer he has levelled directly at your forehead. There's nothing you can do but meekly raise your arms in surrender as the groaning brute behind you gets back on his feet and retrieves your lost weapon. Well, <i>now</i> the fight is over...
Your vision blackens as a bag is pulled over your head.

"You won't get away with this!" you exclaim, but the men pay your complaints no mind as one grabs your wrists and ties them behind your back. A second later you feel a shove that sends you stumbling a few feet forward, and then another just as you regain your balance. Quickly deducing the intent behind this roughness, you start walking forward blindly.
Every now and then as you make your way in darkness, another sudden push redirects you. It's far from gentle, but presumably it's better than walking face-first into a stalagmite or some other unseen hazard.
After traveling like this for what feels like hours, the relative silence is replaced with the increasingly loud sound of machinery, and then voices (though you can't make out what they're saying). Suddenly your vision is restored as the bag is ripped off your head, and you find you are being led into a vast underground chamber nothing like the tunnels you remember entering.
The rock walls have given way to reinforced steel plates, stretching into a massive dome above you. Bright fluorescent lights and blinking LEDs sting your eyes as you survey the surroundings: advanced technological contraptions litter the floor space, and a number of men and women in white lab-coats bustle around hurriedly from monitor to monitor. The scale of this operation is enormous; who could've guessed that the ball diamond was just a front for a no-holds-barred secret subterranean base!
Noticing a delay in your steps as you recover and take it all in, your captors give you yet another brusque push and continue the forced march towards the center of the metallic hemisphere. You consider your options and come to the conclusion that right now, you don't really have any—other than to play along and continue following your captors' directions. You don't know what they're planning to do with you, but you have a feeling you're about to find out.

[[Turn to page #.|chamber]]

title: chamber

Your captors lead you through the giant steel dome to a set of doors. The doors automatically glide apart with a slight whooshing noise. The men nudge you and you walk through the door. You're in a corridor now, still made of steel. You walk down the hall, stopping at each fork in the path. One of the men grumbles "left" and "right" when he wants you to turn. Occasionally, a scientist walks by, with a clipboard, or a steel case that you're sure must contain something important or dangerous. Or both.
Finally, the men guide you through another automatic door and into a medium-sized room. It looks like an operating room. A couple of scientists - who look a little too much like surgeons for your liking -- mill about the operating table, fiddling with various machines and tools. The men cut the rope around your wrists. They gesture to their guns to remind you that running would be futile. You gulp.
One of the scientists (surgeons?) approaches you and takes off their surgical mask. "Hi there," says the scientist. "I'm Dr. Marshall. But you can call me Dr. Maria!"
"Hello," you stammer, not sure how to respond.
"Sorry about the whole, ehhh, kidnapping thing," says Maria, looking sheepish, and gesturing to the men with the guns. "It's just sort of a top-secret experiment-y laboratory thing going on down here! You know how it is." She turns to flicks a switch on a nearby machine, and turns back to you. "Right! So. Since you're here, I thought I'd make you a proposition."

[[Turn to page #.|chamber2]]

"We've been doing these, er, experiments. The Army gives us a lot of money, so we try to keep them happy, you know? Anyway, sorry," Dr. Maria pauses to flick another switch, and take a drink from a nearby glass of water. "Where was I? Right! So we've developed this super cool super strength serum! Problem is, we've been having trouble finding... volunteers." She stares at you, expectantly. You gulp again. This doesn't sound good at all. You turn to look at the men with guns, who glare at you. One of them shakes their head.
"It's not a huge thing, I mean, you'll have to fight a few guys, go on secret missions to the Middle East, you know, army stuff! You'll be a real war hero, kiddo!" Dr. Maria puts a hand on your shoulder. "You want to be a hero, right?"
Being a hero sounds pretty cool to you, but you're not sure you want to help the government invade and oppress other countries. Of course, if you  say no, you'll probably get riddled with bullets. This isn't exactly a great set of choices. But maybe there's something else you can do.

You can't see any way out of this. You nod sadly at Dr. Maria. She smiles warmly and guides you to the table. "Now, we're gonna need to strap you in here. Once the serum his your bloodstream, things are gonna get a little, uhhh, gruesome!" The doctor presses some buttons on the surrounding machine, and pulls a syringe seemingly out of nowhere. The syringe is attached by a hose to one of the machines. "You ready?" asks Dr. Maria. You nod, and she slams the needle into your arm.
Your mind explodes into overdrive. You can barely think as your whole body shakes and begins to transform. You feel an intense dull pain as your muscles expand and grow. You start to feel angry. REALLY angry. Why are you being contained?? You try to struggle out of the restraints to no avail.
As the pain subsides, you start to think clearly again. Dr. Maria is jumping up and down excitedly. "We did it! You're beautiful! Wait 'til the boys upstairs see you!"
Sure enough, the boys upstairs are a fan. You look at yourself in a mirror and see an enormous monster looking back at you. Maybe this super soldier thing won't be so bad, you think.
But once they put you out in the field, you realize there's no joy in your work. With a mere touch, you can make armies fall, communities crumble. The government sends you in to wreak havoc, and they swoop in to plunder the scorched land. You wish that you refused the injection and tried to escape, even if it meant certain death. That, at least, would have been honourable.

You summon your magic ring. Instinctually, you press the power gem and the world around you goes white. You find yourself on your front porch next to a very confused Laney and Sally. "How did we get here?" asks Sally. You'd reply, but you're a bit confused yourself. When did you get a magic ring? How did you know how to use it? You sort of gesture to your ring, as if to explain their sudden appearance, but your friends just look around, still groggy and a little lost. 
Your parents come out onto the porch and rush in to wrap you in a hug. "We're so proud of you, honey!" your mother says. "Your first occurrence!"
"That means the first time you used magic, kiddo!" Your dad explains. Your parents take you and your friends inside as they talk about your magical bloodline. Apparently you come from a long line of wizards and witches. You can hardly believe it! Laney and Sally can hardly believe it either, but they're happy for you anyway. Your parents chatter excitedly about magic school and buying you spell books. What a strange end to the day's adventures! But you suspect this is only the beginning of another story...

Without giving it a second thought, you break into a dash, closing the distance between yourself and the subterranean lake in a matter of seconds, transitioning gracefully into a dive right as you reach the water's edge. No sooner than you are fully submerged, you start into a rapid breast-stroke to pull yourself even deeper into the shimmering blue waters.
As you swim, you hear a few dull popping sounds from behind you, and a thin streak of bubbles cuts a line through the water just inches to the right of your head, accompanied by a sharp <smallcaps>*fizz*</smallcaps>. Good golly, are they actually shooting at you?!
You continue diving deeper, forcing yourself to the bottom of the basin as quickly as you can while bullets pierce the water's surface above you. At this depth you can feel a current pulling you towards one of the underwater channels, and the closer you get the more sure you are that you won't be able to fight it if you keep going. You could give in to the current in order to get away from these amateur gunmen, or you could break free from its pull and look for an alternative means of egress.

With a powerful kick, you push yourself out of the current's pull. Rather than risk drawing fire by going back up to the surface for air, you continue swimming along the bottom of the pool and make an effort to get to the other side on your original breath.
Steadily making your way across, you expect to hear the splash of a pursuer jumping in after you, but it never comes. You pause to take a look behind you: it's difficult to make out what's happening above the surface from this depth, but it appears that the two men are simply standing at the water's edge where you jumped in, not doing anything. They've even holstered their weapons?
You're not sure what their strategy is: given that there's two of them, one could have easily dived into the water while the other monitored you from afar. There doesn't seem to be a clear path on dry land to the other side of the lake; at this rate you'll be able to emerge on the other side home free and they don't even seem to be trying to stop you.
Your thoughts are interrupted by an increasingly painful stinging in your eyes: it's not like you exactly had time to put on goggles before your impromptu swimming session. This, combined with your lungs burning for air and the apparent complacency of your attackers, is enough to make you decide to surface. Breaching with all the grace of a humpback, you immediately take a few deep breaths and try to recover. Eyes still stinging, you blink a few times and bring a forearm up to wipe the water away from your face. When you lower it, you're surprised to find that not only is your vision still blurred, but there are now two bright streaks of red on your arm. A couple blinks later, and your entire vision has taken on a dark, pinkish tint.
It takes a bit longer for the pain to subside, and by the time it does, you're completely blind.

Deciding that you'd rather risk a potential drowning over almost certain bullet wounds, you plunge yourself through the entrance of the underwater channel and immediately find yourself tumbling faster and faster through a well-worn tube of stone. You notice that the blue light from the lake has been steadily fading, and that you're quickly nearing pitch black darkness now. Whatever was causing the glow must have been isolated to that central repository.
The channel twists and turns as it goes on, occasionally slamming you into the sides and bouncing you off corners; you're going to have more than a couple bruises if this keeps up. You try to ignore the pain and focus on holding your breath. Your personal record is just over 2 minutes, but that was in your friend Sally's backyard swimming pool, not careening your way through some sort of crazy aquifer water-slide!
The current carries you deeper and deeper underground with no signs of letting up, and just when you think you're at your lungs' limit, you feel a shock of cold air hit your left foot. Heart thumping and struggling to get your bearings after having been tossed and turned for what felt like ages, you realize that the channel is no longer filled to the top with water and there are small pockets of air whizzing by above you! It takes a couple agonizing tries to time it properly, but you manage to get another breath of air which carries you to the end of the channel, where it deposits you in a basin much like the larger lake somewhere above and behind you.

Thankful for the ample supply of oxygen, you take a few moments to simply tread water and breathe deeply. The dank, stale air of the caverns may as well be a cool spring breeze after what you've been through.
It looks like the basin you've ended up in is being actively fed by the current which dragged you here. There are no similar channels leading outwards from this area though, and the water is constantly overflowing in small streams and seeping through various tiny cracks and crevices. There's a single gap in the walls that looks wide enough for you to fit through. Seems to be your only option for getting out of here. The only other hole that seems person-sized is the channel you rode into here, and you're certainly not going back that way.
You briefly recall the reasons for putting yourself through that watery heck-hole and wonder if your pursuers were persistent enough to have followed suit. You're fairly certain it was narrow enough in some parts that they would have gotten stuck (sucks to be them), so whether they did or not, you should be able to relax for the time being.

Snapping your thoughts back into action, you wade towards the edge the pool. It's nice to be on solid ground again, but you're absolutely soaked. Drenched through and through. You spend a bit of time wringing the water from your clothes, but you'd kill for a towel right about now. Still dripping wet, you start squeezing through the small vertical slit. It's a tight fit -- hopefully it widens up somewhere down the line or you're just going to end up wet, sore, and stuck.

It's the day of the 2nd grade field trip, and you can't wait. You and your friends Laney and Sally have been waiting for this all year. This year, you're going to Fenway Park to get a tour!

You, Laney, and Sally are all on the local girl's little league team. Laney is the shortstop, Sally is the pitcher, and you're the star hitter. You're also the left outfielder, but you're not very good at catching. Or throwing. But you sure can hit the ball. The three of you are looking forward to seeing all the amazing things the park has to offer. It's been through a lot since it opened in 1912, but it looks as good as ever. You look forward to seeing the Green Monster, the giant green wall of concrete and plastic along the left field. Your dad told you that there are dents in the wall from baseballs, and you want to see for yourself.

Miss Inglewood talks to the man at the front gate. He says something to her, and she leads your class through the turnstiles and into a set of tunnels. Your group keeps walking and eventually makes it out onto the field itself. The park looks so much bigger from the inside. The grass smells freshly cut and the sky above is bright and blue. The Green Monster looms in your peripheral vision. Laney nudges you and points to the famous Lone Red Seat in the stands. You can feel it -- this is going to be an amazing day.

"Isn't it wonderful?" says Miss Inglewood. You nod your head. It's all you could have hoped for in a ball park.

Miss Inglewood leaves to go get the tour guide. The other kids mull about the field, talking or playing games. You hang around Laney and Sally.

"We should go exploring while Miss Inglewood's gone," says Laney. She's the adventurous one of your group. Sally agrees. You think it would be pretty amazing to explore the park unsupervised, but you also think that you should stay with the group.

"Come on," says Sally. "Don't be a wuss."

Laney and Sally groan when you tell them that you should stay with the group, but they agree to stay. You sit down in the grass and make small talk for a little while.

After a few minutes, Miss Inglewood returns with a woman in a clean uniform. She must be the tour guide. The tour guide waves and, once she is within earshot, addresses the group.

"Good afternoon, class! My name is Amy, and I will be your tour guide today."

"Hi, Amy!" chants the class.

"Are you looking forward to the tour?" asks Amy. The class agrees enthusiastically. Amy smiles and asks the class to follow her. Laney rolls her eyes at you. You grin and shrug. You follow the rest of the class and get ready to start the tour.

Amy the tour guide leads your class to the home team's dugout. You all help each other climb into the deep recess. After you were all inside the dugout, Amy began her talk. "Fenway Park was built in 1911 under the guidance of John Irving Taylor," she said. "Mr. Taylor was the owner of the Boston Red Sox at the time, and he wanted a baseball stadium for his team." Amy goes through a door and leads you deeper into the stadium. The class crowds excitedly into a small-ish stone hallway.

You lean over to say something to Laney, but she isn't next to you anymore. Uh oh! Did she run off to explore without you? As you turn around to look for Laney, you bump into her. "Ouch!" hisses Laney.

"Sorry!" you whisper back. Something moves in the corner of you eye and you look, just to see Mrs. Inglewood slip through an unlabelled door. Very strange. Shouldn't she be supervising the class? Laney nudges you.

"Now's our chance!" she whispers. You do kind of want to see where Mrs. Inglewood is going. But you hate to break the rules, even if your teacher is behaving strangely.

You grab Laney and Sally's hands and lead them to the unlabelled door. You glance back at Amy the tour guide, but she seems to be distracted by her tour guide spiel. You take a deep breath and open the door. The room beyond is dim. You don't see any side of your teacher, though, so you head inside.

The room appears to be a storage space. There are rows of metal shelves, covered in baseball gear and boxes. In the far corner there is a large sink and some cleaning supplies. The three of you split up and being to explore. 

After a few minutes, Sally calls out to you. She's standing by the sink. You head over. "There are footprints here," says Sally. "And I think this is a scrap of Mrs. Inglewood's dress!" Laney jumps up and down, excitedly.

"A secret passage!" she exclaims. You'd definitely agree with that. But how are you going to open it?

You turn the left knob. The sink shudders and begins to slide to the right, revealing a small tunnel. You're wary of entering, but by the time you try to say something, Laney is already inside, and Sally is starting to go in. You sigh, and follow your friends into the tunnel. Someone's got to watch out for these two!

The tunnel is chilly, and a bit damp. You crawl for what seems like ten minutes, going through various twists and turns. Finally, you reach an exit. 

"Cool! Let's see what's going on!" Laney exclaims.
Before she can burst out onto the scene, you quickly put your hand on her shoulder.

"Hey! What gives?"

You slowly let go of her shoulder. This may be a weird situation, but what's the worst that could possibly happen? Free of your grasp, Laney and Sally jump out of the tunnel's exit into the strange hallway. 

"Wow what is this place? It's so weird!" says Sally, with a hint of nervousness creeping into her voice.
You slowly begin to crawl forward to meet them when you suddenly hear footsteps. Laney and Sally both look up to the right.

"Sorry girls, but no students allowed," the voice says. It was Ms. Inglewood.
You see both of your friends take a few steps back. "Ms. Inglewood, where are we? What's going on!" Sally cries out.
"I may be your teacher, but today I'm not taking any more questions. Class is dismissed," Ms. Inglewood says menacingly.
Laney and Sally turn to run when suddenly a bright flash of light and crackling sound fills the tunnel.

Frantically you turn around and start crawling back through the tunnel, still blinded by the flash of light. The smell of burnt hair fills your nostrils, sending you into a panic. You desperately grope your hand against the wall to help guide you out but find a particularly moist section. Your hand slips, causing you to fall and let out a yelp.

"Oh, looks like someone has joined us for detention," sneers Ms. Inglewood.

Eyes blurred you look back down the tunnel and see Ms. Inglewood pointing some sort of contraption at you. Another flash of light fills the tunnel. 

You hear nothing.

Blinded, you suddenly realize the smell of burnt hair has filled your hiding spot.

"Pity," you hear Ms. Inglewood chortle, "You were both such bright students!"

You clamp your hands over your mouth. To prevent you from screaming or vomitting, you don't know. Either way it seems to do the trick. You hear Ms. Inglewood begin to walk again and soon you hear her footsteps dissapear in the distance. As your vision returns you decide what you must do next.

This is crazy! Ms. Inglewood is some kind of crazy mad scientist with a raygun! What are you supposed to do! You do the sensible thing and turn around and scramble out of the tunnels and back to the dugout. 

Frantically you try to look for someone to tell, preferably an adult. Then you see out on the field, Amy, still leading the class giving her schpiel. She'll have to do. Almost out of breath, you run towards her screaming. Her and the rest of the class turn to you, looking very confused. As you make it past first base you suddenly hear a loud CHUNK sound. CHUNK.

CHUNK CHUNK CHUNK.

The sound speeds up in frequency, almost like large mechanical gears turning. Underfoot you feel the ground begin to shake. In front of you a crack appears in the turf, quickly growing until a huge chasm is between you and the rest of the school group.

"HAHAHAHAHAHA!" you hear the cackle of Ms. Inglewood come from the unseen depths.

The ground begins to shake again, and from the shadows appears some sort of large machine, rising from the Earth.

"What in the world!" you hear Amy shout from across the gap.
Now towering in front of you, you see it. A giant laser.

"Finally I have the means to fullfill my ultimate goal!" shouts Ms. Inglewood triumphantly.
"Why are you doing this!" you cry out.

"It's simple really," says Ms. Inglewood. "You see, I never wanted to have to teach you stupid brats. I was supposed to go to Harvard for a double major in Areospace Engineering and Chemistry! I was going to be famous! I had worked so hard my entire life, prepared for years. I had the perfect application! But the stupid postal service in this forsaken city had lost my application! I knew something was wrong when I hadn't heard from them immediately. I waited weeks and not a single peep! That's when I called and they told me that my application had never even arrived. I told them there was some kind of mistake, that I had sent my application, that I would go and deliver it to them in person if I had to, but they said it was too late. They were giving me! A genius! The cold-shoulder! How dare they! From that day on I began my plan to destroy this horrid reminder of what I could have been, and wiping it from the face of the Earth!"

After finishing her monologue, Ms. Inglewood reaches to the large lever beside her, and pulls it. A terrifying noise fills the air and electricity begins to spark from the end of the laser.

The last thing you see is the psychotic smile on Ms. Inglewood's face.

You pull Laney and Sally back into the tunnel, telling them you all need to be more cautious. From outside into the hallway the three of you hear footsteps quickly approaching. 

"Do you think that's Ms. Inglewo--" Laney trys to say before you cover her mouth. After waiting a moment the sound of footsteps fade away into the distance. Laney shakes free of your grasp. 

"Okay enough hanging out in cramped tunnels," she says taking hold of you and Sally's hand as she jumps out into the hallway.
"Well this is creepy."
Your trio examines the long, dim hallway. The ceiling and walls just covered in wires and tubes filled with strange glowing liquid.
"What is this place? Is Ms. Inglewood some sort of mad scientist?" whispers Sally.
"Well she's not just a teacher, that's obviously clear," you reply.
"She's up to something sinister, that seems pretty clear too," snaps Laney. "We have to find out what she's up to. Come on."

You follow the strange hallway in the direction of Ms. Inglewood. On the way you see a bunch of wires leading to what appears to be a large battery.
"What should we do guys?" Sally asks.

"Well I doubt that it's powering a merry-go round," Laney says walking up to the battery.
She gives it a push. It doesn't seem to have any effect.
"Gah, this thing weighs a ton! C'mon help me out here!" She yells.
As you step up, the ground begins to shake. Looking around you can see the pipes of glowing liquid begin to flow in the direction Ms. Inglewood went.
"Hurry!" Laney yells.

The three of you begin pushing on the battery with all of your might as dust falls from the celing and the ground conintues to shake.
Finally with a final heave you are able to remove the giant battery from place. Almost immediately the shaking stops, as well as the flow of the liquid. You look further down a hall and see what looks to be sunlight coming from a slightly ajar door. As fast as you can muster, you run with your friends towards it.

Opening the door you find a giant room with no ceiling, and a giant contraption towering over you, peaking its head above ground.
Above you hear Ms. Inglewood yelling and cursing as police helicopters appear in the sky. You begin to yell and flail your arms about to try and get their attention. After your rescue you learn that Ms. Inglewood was a disgruntled genius that had a bone to pick with the city of Boston.

You and your friends are praised as heroes, and are given the key to the city!

Congratulations!

"This doesn't look very safe guys. Lets just keep going," you say as you back away from the giant hazard. You look further down the hallway and see a closed door. Slowly your group inches foward. Dust begins to fall from the ceiling.

"What's going on," says Sally nervously.

Suddenly the hallway begins to shake. You look around frantically and see all of the green liquid in the pipes has begun flowing towards the closed door.

"C'mon guys lets hurry!" Laney yells.

The three of you begin sprinting forward. But the vibrations continue to get worse. Sally trips and falls to the ground beside you. You can hear the ground above cracking. Laney runs back to Sally to try and help her. You look up at the ceiling just in time to see a giant slab of concrete falling towards your head.

The three of you are never seen again.

You can't just let Ms. Inglewood get away with this. You decide you must do something! To stop whatever she's planning! 
You exit the tunnel and find a long, dimly lit hallway. The ceiling and walls covered in wires and tubes filled with strange glowing liquid.

"What is this place? Is Ms. Inglewood some sort of mad scientist?" you mutter to yourself. 

You follow the strange hallway in the direction of Ms. Inglewood. On the way you see a bunch of wires leading to what appears to be a large battery.

"What the..."

"Well whatever this is powering can't be good," you say walking up to the battery.
You try to give it a push. It doesn't seem to have any effect. You try again and again, nothing. It's just too heavy for you. If only your friends were still alive.

As you step back, the ground begins to shake. Looking around you can see the pipes of glowing liquid begin to flow in the direction Ms. Inglewood went. The loud ear-peircing sound of machiery soon follows, along with more quakes shaking the hallway with growing intensity. Dust and debris fall on you from the celing.

Down the hallway you see light appear under a door that the quakes have cause to come ajar. As fast as you can muster, you run towards it.

Opening the door you find a giant room with no ceiling, and a giant contraption towering over you, peaking its head above ground. At the seat of the controls you spy none other than Ms. Inglewood, laughing maniaclly. You see her pull a giant lever beside her as eletricity sprouts from the towering object.

It's the last thing you ever see.

"This thing will probably kill me if I touch it," you say hesitantly.

As you step back, the hallway begins to shake. Looking around you can see the pipes of glowing liquid begin to flow in the direction Ms. Inglewood went. The loud ear-peircing sound of machiery soon follows, along with even more intesnse quakes shaking the hallway. Dust and debris fall on you from the ceiling.

Following down the hallway you see light appear under a once locked door that the quakes have caused to open. As fast as you can muster, you run towards it.

You burst through the doorway to find a giant room with no ceiling, and a giant contraption towering over you, peaking its head above the surface. At the seat of the controls you spy none other than Ms. Inglewood, laughing maniaclly. You see her pull a giant lever beside her as eletricity sprouts from the towering object.

You've always been the straight-edge one in the group, and today is no exception. Laney looks towards you expectantly, but you simply walk away with the rest of the class as they start moving on to the next section of the tour. At first, Laney lags behind a bit, clearly torn between the promise of adventure and your lack of cooperation, but she eventually re-joins you and Sally as you make your way onto the field.
Amy continues to make the rounds, pointing out all the different landmarks and the many idiosyncrasies of Fenway's architecture.
In the middle of one of her factoids, one of the other kids shouts out "When are we going to get to play ball!?"
With a sharp sideways glare at the eager beaver, Miss Inglewood reassures your class that you'll all have a chance to play after lunch. Her answer is met with a few mumbles and grumbles, but no one else interrupts for the rest of the morning. Soon, you're all lining up at the concession stands for hot-dogs and soda pops. Plopping yourself down with Laney and Sally as usual, you're worried Laney might be a little peeved for getting shut down earlier. Turns out you have nothing to worry about though, and the three of you are soon chatting like usual as you chomp down in preparation for the coming ball game.

The sun is high in the cloudless sky as Miss Inglewood leads the class back out onto the field for the main event. The three of you are way ahead of the group and already geared up, and your teacher is far too busy dealing with a rowdy crowd of excited children to notice a few of them getting a bit ahead of themselves. Sally and Laney quickly declare themselves team captains and begin recruiting classmates one by one as they make it out to the diamond.
They take turns, alternating between picking the best players and their best friends.
"I pick... Jane!"
"Terry, get over here!"
"Um... Ashley."
"Jul- no, Charlie!"
It goes on and on like this, and you can't help but feel they're forgetting something. Soon enough, all the other kids have been spoken for, but you still don't have a team!
"C'mon, let's go!" says Sally as she grabs your hand and starts to lead you off. "Hey", protests a confused Laney, "I thought you were on my side!"
It looks like both of them just assumed you were already on their team from the get-go! They're probably not going to be able to work this one out amongst themselves: it's up to you to decide who you want to carry to victory and who will be crushed by the might of your combined forces.

Sensing a hostility brewing that you're really just not comfortable with, you decide to sit this one out. You explain that it's not that you don't want to play, or that you're mad at Laney or Sally -- you want to be a part of this group! It's just that you already have a very stressful life outside of baseball, and this was supposed to be your big day to leave all that behind and enjoy yourself. You do <i>not</i> want to be the source of drama, especially in such a public and otherwise welcoming setting, and would much rather just take a break from it than exacerbate the problem.
Your friends are disappointed, but understanding, and the two teams set off to play their game while you take a seat on the bench.
You can't help but feel a bit left out of course, but even if you aren't playing, you can still have a good time. You cheer on your classmates, ooh-ing and aah-ing as both teams hit their highs and lows. After some time, Miss Inglewood takes a seat next to you.
"For what it's worth, I think you made the right decision." She doesn't bother to lower her gaze from the game while speaking to you. "Your friends, your classmates -- these children-"
She pauses to take a bite of her hot-dog.
"-they aren't like you or me. Look at them, running around out there like animals!"
A low chuckle escapes her lips. "They live like animals, and one day, so too will they die like animals." Unsure of what to say in response, you simply sit silently as she takes a sip from a cup of cola, stands up, and marches out onto the field to break up a shouting match over whether Sally was safe or out.
You're never quite sure what Miss Inglewood was talking about, but even now, years later, you can't help but think back to that day at the baseball diamond and feel like you missed out on something greater.

You turn the right knob. The sink shudders, then goes quiet. Suddenly, the floor opens up beneath you. You, Sally, and Laney fall into a deep pit. You try to climb the walls, but they are very smooth. Mrs. Inglewood leans over the edge of the pit with a flashlight.

"This is what happens when you don't stick with the group, girls!" And with that, she disappears. You call out for help, but your teacher doesn't come back. There doesn't seem to be anyone else around to hear you.

It's your first day at magic school, and you can hardly wait. It's been years since you first discovered your magic powers on that fateful school field trip to Fenway Park. You were too young to attend a magic school at the time, so you kept going to your school and pretending to be a "regular" (that's what your parents call them). You're going to miss your "regular" friends, Laney and Sally, now that you're going to a different school. But you're going to keep in touch.
Your father shuts off the car engine and goes to the back to open the trunk to get your suitcase. You wonder why you bothered to drive here instead of using magic. Dad says it wasn't an experience you were ready for but a part of you doesn't believe him. 
Maybe he was just used to his regular ways after living among them for so long. You and your mother step out of the car as your dad comes around with your suitcase.
"You'll be taking the ferry from here," he says, pointing to the run down ship in the distance.
"We're so proud that you were able to the top magic school in the county!", exclaims your Mom as tears slowly drip from her eyes.

You lean in towards your parents, wrapping your arms around them. "I love you guys," you say as your voice cracks under the weight of their expectations.
"We love you too. We know you'll do fantastic at school!" your father says softly as his eyes begin to water.
Slowly you pull back from your parent's embrace. Their tears have left small salty stains on your coat.
"I've put a little surprise in your suitcase, make sure you wait until you get to your dorm room to open it!" your mother says gleefully.
"You have about half and hour before the ship leaves. If you're hungry they should have some food on the ferry. From what I remember it wasn't the best but it'll do," your father warns.
"Now get going. Make lots of friends!"
You say your final goodbyes and you turn towards the ship. You see some other students have started to congregate in front of the ramp leading to the deck.

You stand still and don't move a muscle. You can feel your eyes drying as you stare blankly at your parents. Shame and regret fills their face.
Quickly you realize how awkward you've made this situation, but you're too stunned to take corrective action.
"We know you're nervous, but please try to not embarrass yourself. And please try to make some friends. I know you have a difficult time but just try," your Mom says with a hint of disdain.
You've known for a while your social skills have been lacking. Most of your friendships up to this point have been due to convenience and proximity, and your weird penchant to hang around the neighbourhood kids without saying a word.
Maybe this will be the year, your year. The year you finally take the first steps into be a regular non-regular magical person.

Your mother slowly reaches out her hand and nudges you in the shoulder.

A horn bellows in the distance. You can feel the vibrations enter your ears and resonate with your body.
"It's been half an hour already! You have to hurry to the boat now!" your Dad shouts behind you.
You try to lift your foot but it is firmly planted in place. Thoughts fill your mind. How you'll be letting your family down if you don't make it onto the ferry.
How you'll be throwing away the years of magic training you have gone through. About all of the work and time your parents have invested into you. All for nothing.

Finally you snap out of your trance. Feeling as though a hex has been lifted your heart races. You run forward a few feet before returning to grab your suitcase. You sprint as fast as you can towards the ship. Magic, while convenient, has also caused you to be a tad out of shape and unfortunately the use of magic at your age can only be used in emergency and educational situations. Its not like you teleportation skills were that great anyway and you wouldn't want to get off on the wrong foot with your new classmates, which would be more likely to happen if you showed up to your first day with only one.
Ahead you see the students slowly make their way up the ramp to the deck.
"Hurry up kid or we're going to set sail without you!" shouts a man from the bow.

As you sprint you see the deck hands begin to untie the knots holding the ferry to the dock. Out of surprising coincidence your shoelaces decide to follow suit and untie themselves. With an exasperated yell you trip and fall face first into the concrete. Could this be the end of your whole magical career, right then and there? "No," you mutter under your breath. You close your eyes and concentrate, imagining your body moving from where you are, with your face bloodied and arms scraped, to the deck of the ferry. You feel heat slowly build up inside of you, and suddenly feel it release from your body.

You open your eyes laying on your back. Students and crew members surround you, their eyes wide. "I did it," you think to yourself. You try to get up but your exhaustion prevents you. You close your eyes once more. Suddenly a young boy beside you screams out. You open your eyes to look at his face, morphed hideously by terror. Beside him one of the crew members vomits.
"Someone get the nurse! Quick!" shouts a voice you cannot see.
You wonder what could be going on as you feel a liquid start pooling around your ear. Using what remains of your strength you try to look around.
You see blood. A lot of blood.
It turns out you were as good at magic as you thought, but less than you hoped, and that your top half is no long on top of your bottom half.
The remaining students are too mortified by the sight of you to continue with the school year. The magical community takes a huge hit due to a generation of uneducated individuals.

The salt in the air fills your nostrils as you begin to walk around the docks. You're reminded of the summer days you spent at the beach with your family. To your right you see a boat of fishermen set off in the early morning. The seagulls hitching a ride squack in excitement. You feel the breeze of the ocean as it gently blows across your face. It fills you with determination.

Suddenly the sound of the ships horn cracks through the serene setting! Time to begin your journey.

As you get closer to the boat you see the rest of the students begin to line up and prepare boarding the vessel. At the front is a tall woman with a stern face, staring in your direction. You decide to pick up the pace and fall in to the back of the line just as it begins moving. Looking around at all the faces of your fellow students, you realize how many other irregulars there were. Until today your parents were the only magic users you knew but now they were everywhere. You hope someone won't accidentally sneeze and sink the ship on your journey.
"Hurry now! Quit your daydreaming!" the woman snaps. "We must leave on time. The ferry hasn't had a late departure in over 500 years and we won't be breaking that tradition today over the likes of you!"
Nervous, you drag your suitcase up the ramp, wondering how a 500 year old streak exist in a country that as far as you know was a few centuries younger than that.
You make it to the deck. The other students have already seated, and seemingly split into cliques.
"That was quick," you mutter to yourself.
Before you, you see a shy group of individuals quietly talking amongst themselves and trying to not be a bother to anyone.
To your right you spot a rowdier group of kids hanging by the railing, laughing and screaming in a chaotic fashion.

You decide you've had enough excitement for the day and decide to sit with the shy individuals. They all seem nice enough. Some of them seem to be a little anxious as well so at least you have that incommon.

Over the school year you get more and more comfortable hanging around this group and find that you've found some real friends. Throughout your remaining years at school, you face some tough challenges but manage to pull through with each others support.

How nice for you. You've now graduated an accomplished magic user and are ready to start a new life!

Congratulations!

You walk up to the rowdy bunch of kids on the boat. Being shy you're not entirely sure what to say, and they quickly take notice.

"What's wrong huh? Too dumb to speak!" one of them yells, causing an uproar of laughter among them.

You try and laugh with them but it just doesn't feel the same. Over the years you try your best to fit in but nothing seems to work out how you imagined.

Their peer pressure has caused you to do many questionable things throughout your years at school, some leading to serious consequences.

After one night of playing pinklebluks one of the guys dares you to do a handstand on your flying chair. Unfortunately despite your best efforts, you trained in magic, not acrobatics. In you attempt you slip and hit your head on the chair, falling unconcious. Afraid of getting in trouble, no one takes you to the Nurse's quarters.

Hope it was worth it.
