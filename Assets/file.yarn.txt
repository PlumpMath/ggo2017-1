You're no wuss, and you make sure Sally knows as much as the three of you take advantage of Miss Inglewood's absence to break off from the group waiting in the in-field and start climbing your way through the bleachers. No offense to Miss I.'s ability to plan a school trip, but you're fairly certain you don't need a boring old tour guide to know how to have fun at a baseball diamond!
The three of you take turns sitting in the famous red seat marking the longest home run ever hit at the park and watch as your teacher and classmates follow a woman in a white uniform around the field in the distance. They stop a few times along the way, presumably to listen to the tour guide's spiel.
Laney turns to you and Sally and whispers "Hey, do you think they'll be able to see us up here?"
Your classmates aren't paying any attention to the bleachers at the moment, but surely the tour's going to at least mention the Lone Red Seat (seriously -- what tour wouldn't?). It is pretty far out though -- almost 500 feet -- so if you take it easy they probably won't even notice you. You're wearing red today anyways; you'll blend right in.

While the guide's drawing everyone's attention towards the giant green wall, you take the lead and start sneaking your way around to the other side of the bleachers. You have to hush your compatriots multiple times as they giggle their way through your clever maneuver. Peeking out from over the seats, you keep an eye on the rest of your class as they make the rounds. By the time the tour guide points out the crimson chair, your triumvirate is nowhere to be seen.
It seems the bold bleacher was the last stop on the tour, and you watch as your classmates, like a little line of ants, file their way back into the park's interior. You're all scheduled to play a game together on the field after lunch, which means that you've got a whole hour out here to yourself!
Sally and Laney are way ahead of you, and have already started bounding their way back down onto the grass. You chase after them, and soon enough the three of you are racing to see who can complete a lap of the diamond first. They got a head-start, but it's neck-and-neck in the last stretch, at which point it falls apart as all three of you fail to restrain yourselves from trying to dramatically slide into home base and completely undershooting.
As you laugh and dust yourself off, Laney wanders over to the dugout and hops in. She returns wielding a metal bat and a mischievous grin, tossing Sally a couple leftover balls from who-knows-when.

As much as you'd like to indulge in the moment, there's something here that you don't think Laney and Sally will be able to enjoy with you, and now may be your only chance to find it. Before they have a chance to wrangle you into a pickup game, you wonder aloud if there's time for you to grab lunch before Miss Inglewood gets back with the rest of the class and tell them not to wait up for you. They seem a little surprised by your sudden ambivalence as you stride off the diamond, but a couple strikes later and they've got more exciting swings to worry about than your mood.
You make your way inside, but instead of following the sounds of the other children's voices, you start tracing the path you planned out in the days leading up to this trip. A left here, a right just past there -- your heartbeat quickens as you get closer and closer to your goal -- five more steps, then two...
Just as you turn the corner, you spot what you're looking for: the entrance to the home team's locker room! And more importantly: the small section of false plaster on the opposing wall which you know houses the secret passage to the grand sport Cathedral's greatest mystery: the Catacombs of Ba'll.

You run your hands over the wall, examining each and every tiny bump and imperfection, looking for the one that activates whatever hidden mechanism keeps the entrance sealed. It takes a few minutes of careful prodding, but eventually your fingers depress and you hear a soft *<smallcaps>click</smallcaps>* as the wall gives way.
The false plaster starts swinging slowly inwards as you apply more pressure, revolving on a central axis. You crouch your head slightly to make it through the small opening, and make your way inside. The door continues swinging as you do, turning a full 180° before clicking shut, leaving you in the darkness within. You have a nagging suspicion that you won't be able to leave the same way you came in.
Not one to be caught unprepared, you fumble blindly through your pockets for a moment and produce a small flashlight. Illuminating the walls around you, it's clear that you're on the right track, as the construction here is clearly much older. The contemporary plaster of the entrance stands in stark contrast to the crumbling stone and wooden supports that line the rest of the chamber.
Turning your gaze forward, you spot a small staircase a few steps in front of you leading deeper into the darkness. 
Your fore-knowledge of the layout ends here, but looks like you know where you're headed for the time being.

The stairs travel straight down for a few meters through exposed rock. At first it looks like incredibly shoddy workmanship -- hastily hewn stone meant to serve no purpose other than locomotion, but as you walk further down, the rough markings and cuts start to give way to flatter, more refined surfaces. The steps begin to widen, and then transition into a lazy spiral as more and more evidence of artistry appears on the walls that pass you by: a noticeable trim along edges, clear markers every dozen steps, purely aesthetic patterning that must have taken someone ages to carve...
Soon enough, you find yourself slowing to admire details here and there. To think; all this and more could have gone unnoticed by so many for so long! You fight back a slight twinge of guilt as you think of your classmates above, eating hotdogs and playing ball as you explore hidden depths on your own. You remind yourself that they're having a good time too, and of course that yours is an experience that only a select few could appreciate.
Distracted momentarily by your thoughts, you stumble awkwardly as your foot plants down sooner than expected: you've reached the bottom of the stairwell! Recovering your balance, you survey the area. To your left, the floor levels out into a long, narrow tunnel that stretches as far as the beam from your flashlight will reach. To your right lies a small alcove engraved in ornate detail. It may be a good opportunity to try to learn more about these mysterious passageways. On the other hand, you are on a bit of a tight schedule -- maybe you should just keep moving.

You take a closer look at the alcove to your right. It houses a limestone bust portraying a man from the chest up, rendered in exquisite detail. You don't recognize the face, but admire the craft that went into capturing such a striking jawline -- such piercing eyes. You can't help but wonder what it must have looked like before the passage of time stripped it of pigment, but even the raw stone is a thing of beauty.
The figure's arms are held delicately by its sides, elbows bent and palms facing upwards. In his right hand, a similarly sculpted bat is balanced vertically, and in his left, the ball. A small plaque is mounted to the platform on which the statue rests. Shining your flashlight on it, you read the words engraved upon it:

<align=center><smallcaps><i><b><br>Hey batta-hatta bee
Hey hatta-batta hall
Which o'these came first
Bat or the Ba'll?</b></i></smallcaps></align>

Ah, so it's a riddle then? It's pretty clear you're expected to choose from the offerings presented in the figure's hands, though you have no clue what consequences your choice will have.

You're a bit surprised anyone thought this would fool would-be intruders; everyone knows the bat came first. You grasp the stone bat in your hand. A few seconds pass, but nothing happens.
You're sure of your answer, but maybe you've misunderstood the mechanism? Experimenting, you give the bat a light tug. A few more seconds pass, and then you give it a slightly less light tug. On this second attempt, you feel something give way, and the arm holding it starts to swivel on some hidden joint.
There's an ominous creaking and the grinding of stone sliding against stone as you continue to pull the bat down like some sort of lever. As it falls into place, you feel a dull rumbling begin in the floor below you. The rumble grows as it rises up through the walls until the entire chamber is shaking. Dust and rubble start to break loose from the ceiling.
Relatively safe in the confines of the alcove, you watch as cracks shoot through the stairs you were descending just minutes ago, and suddenly there are huge slabs of stone crashing all around them.
By the time the rumbling subsides, a giant pile of rubble blocks what's left of your only known exit to the surface. To be honest, you're not sure if you've triggered a trap, or if this thing just hasn't survived the test of time and fell apart before it could complete its intended purpose. In either case, you're going to have to keep an eye out for a new way out of here. Clouds of dust kicked up by the commotion begin to settle as you consider your options.

Given the circumstances, you're fairly certain there's no way for you to actually figure out what this riddle was intending to communicate during the time of its construction. Language often changes and evolves over the course of a few years, let alone generations. You place your palm on the top of the stone ball and hope for the best.
The arm of the statue lowers and begins to rotate under the weight of your hand. As it does, you feel a sudden rushing sensation: the floor below you just collapsed into a trapdoor! Reflexes kicking in as you start to fall, you manage to hook one flailing hand onto the edge of the newly opened pit.
You glance below you and see your flashlight -- you must have dropped it in the excitement -- tumbling into the darkness below. Watching in horror as your only source of light dims and eventually disappears, you realize just how far you have to fall. Eager to put yourself in a less precarious position, you swing your free arm blindly for a handhold, only to end up knocking a few more rocks loose. Your fingers strain as you hold on for dear life, and the gravity of the situation sets in: you're alone in the dark, no one knows where you are, and the only thing keeping you from a five-storey drop is a bit of rapidly dwindling grip strength.

Obviously, the riddle is a trick question: without the ball, what use would you have for the bat, and vice versa? The two go hand in hand, and following that logic, you simultaneously reach out with both hands to grasp the stone sports gear.
It occurs to you a few moments later that you may have been a bit too hasty in coming to that clever conclusion. You take comfort in the fact that this self-doubt will soon be cut short as you plummet through the crumbling floor and into the pit below.

The passageway widens as you make your way forwards, and the walls give way to more and more natural formations, with only the path itself maintaining the smooth, carved stone from before.
It doesn't take an expert to realize that these tunnels are ancient. Massive spires of rock and mineral hang from the ceiling and jut out of the ground, their faces lined with the many layers of sediment deposits and smoothed with erosion.
As you continue walking, they eventually open up further into a vast underground lake, its bed pock-marked with dozens of channels leading who-knows-where. The surface of the lake is so blue as to appear glowing in comparison to the dim lighting you've had to navigate thus far. You've heard of species of bioluminescent algae said to produce a similar effect, though they usually require a steady cycle of daylight. Perhaps something else is causing the brightness?
Each footstep you take as you make your way towards the water's edge to investigate triggers a trailing cacophony of echoes, sounds bouncing and reverberating throughout the vast caverns. You stop to enjoy the acoustics for a moment, and suddenly realize that the footsteps didn't stop until a moment after you had planted your feet. You're being followed!
Listening carefully, you try to pin-point the source of the other steps. The natural reverb makes it difficult to be certain, but you estimate there to be two adult men in leather moccasins trailing you, at least one of which is almost within striking distance. You could try to take advantage of the fact that they've lost the element of surprise to launch an immediate counter-offensive, or you could go for a dive and try to lose them in the depths below.

If these punks think they can get the jump on you, they've got another thing coming! Having taken stock of the situation, you draw your trusty Smith & Wesson Model 40 snub-nosed revolver from the folds of your jacket in a split-second, but your opponents are even faster: before you even have a chance to line up an attack, a lightning-quick karate chop knocks the weapon from your hand and sends it clattering along the stone floor to the left.
Not one to give up easily, you grab your attacker's arm and use his weight to judo flip him over your shoulder. The towering man is sent tumbling through the air in a magnificent arc, and there's a thundering <smallcaps>*smack*</smallcaps> and the wheeze of forced exhalation as your assailant lands flat on his back. Not bad, but the fight's not over yet.
You adopt a defensive stance as you turn to face the remaining attacker, only to find yourself staring down the twin barrels of the Remington Over-Under Double Derringer he has levelled directly at your forehead. There's nothing you can do but meekly raise your arms in surrender as the groaning brute behind you gets back on his feet and retrieves your lost weapon. Well, <i>now</i> the fight is over...
Your vision blackens as a bag is pulled over your head.

"You won't get away with this!" you exclaim, but the men pay your complaints no mind as one grabs your wrists and ties them behind your back. A second later you feel a shove that sends you stumbling a few feet forward, and then another just as you regain your balance. Quickly deducing the intent behind this roughness, you start walking forward blindly.
Every now and then as you make your way in darkness, another sudden push redirects you. It's far from gentle, but presumably it's better than walking face-first into a stalagmite or some other unseen hazard.
After traveling like this for what feels like hours, the relative silence is replaced with the increasingly loud sound of machinery, and then voices (though you can't make out what they're saying). Suddenly your vision is restored as the bag is ripped off your head, and you find you are being led into a vast underground chamber nothing like the tunnels you remember entering.
The rock walls have given way to reinforced steel plates, stretching into a massive dome above you. Bright fluorescent lights and blinking LEDs sting your eyes as you survey the surroundings: advanced technological contraptions litter the floor space, and a number of men and women in white labcoats bustle around hurriedly from monitor to monitor. The scale of this operation is enormous; who could've guessed that the ball diamond was just a front for a no-holds-barred secret subterranean base!
Noticing a delay in your steps as you recover and take it all in, your captors give you yet another brusque push and continue the forced march towards the center of the metallic hemi-sphere. You consider your options and come to the conclusion that right now, you don't really have any—other than to play along and continue following your captors' directions. You don't know what they're planning to do with you, but you have a feeling you're about to find out.

Without giving it a second thought, you break into a dash, closing the distance between yourself and the subterranean lake in a matter of seconds, transitioning gracefully into a dive right as you reach the water's edge. No sooner than you are fully submerged, you start into a rapid breast-stroke to pull yourself even deeper into the shimmering blue waters.
As you swim, you hear a few dull popping sounds from behind you, and a thin streak of bubbles cuts a line through the water just inches to the right of your head, accompanied by a sharp <smallcaps>*fizz*</smallcaps>. Good golly, are they actually shooting at you?!
You continue diving deeper, forcing yourself to the bottom of the basin as quickly as you can while bullets pierce the water's surface above you. At this depth you can feel a current pulling you towards one of the underwater channels, and the closer you get the more sure you are that you won't be able to fight it if you keep going. You could give in to the current in order to get away from these amateur gunmen, or you could break free from its pull and look for an alternative means of egress.

With a powerful kick, you push yourself out of the current's pull. Rather than risk drawing fire by going back up to the surface for air, you continue swimming along the bottom of the pool and make an effort to get to the other side on your original breath.
Steadily making your way across, you expect to hear the splash of a pursuer jumping in after you, but it never comes. You pause to take a look behind you: it's difficult to make out what's happening above the surface from this depth, but it appears that the two men are simply standing at the water's edge where you jumped in, not doing anything. They've even holstered their weapons?
You're not sure what their strategy is: given that there's two of them, one could have easily dived into the water while the other monitored you from afar. There doesn't seem to be a clear path on dry land to the other side of the lake; at this rate you'll be able to emerge on the other side home free and they don't even seem to be trying to stop you.
Your thoughts are interrupted by an increasingly painful stinging in your eyes: it's not like you exactly had time to put on goggles before your impromptu swimming session. This, combined with your lungs burning for air and the apparent complacency of your attackers, is enough to make you decide to surface. Breaching with all the grace of a humpback, you immediately take a few deep breaths and try to recover. Eyes still stinging, you blink a few times and bring a forearm up to wipe the water away from your face. When you lower it, you're surprised to find that not only is your vision still blurred, but there are now two bright streaks of red on your arm. A couple blinks later, and your entire vision has taken on a dark, pinkish tint.
It takes a bit longer for the pain to subside, and by the time it does, you're completely blind.

Deciding that you'd rather risk a potential drowning over almost certain bullet wounds, you plunge yourself through the entrance of the underwater channel and immediately find yourself tumbling faster and faster through a well-worn tube of stone. You notice that the blue light from the lake has been steadily fading, and that you're quickly nearing pitch black darkness now. Whatever was causing the glow must have been isolated to that central repository.
The channel twists and turns as it goes on, occasionally slamming you into the sides and bouncing you off corners; you're going to have more than a couple bruises if this keeps up. You try to ignore the pain and focus on holding your breath. Your personal record is just over 2 minutes, but that was in your friend Sally's backyard swimming pool, not careening your way through some sort of crazy aquifer waterslide!
The current carries you deeper and deeper underground with no signs of letting up, and just when you think you're at your lungs' limit, you feel a shock of cold air hit your left foot. Heart thumping and struggling to get your bearings after having been tossed and turned for what felt like ages, you realize that the channel is no longer filled to the top with water and there are small pockets of air whizzing by above you! It takes a couple agonizing tries to time it properly, but you manage to get another breath of air which carries you to the end of the channel, where it deposits you in a basin much like the larger lake somewhere above and behind you.

Thankful for the ample supply of oxygen, you take a few moments to simply tread water and breathe deeply. The dank, stale air of the caverns may as well be a cool spring breeze after what you've been through. You briefly recall the reasons for putting yourself through that watery heck-hole and wonder if your pursuers were persistent enough to have followed suit. You're fairly certain it was narrow enough in some parts that they would have gotten stuck (sucks to be them), so whether they did or not, you should be able to relax for the time being.
